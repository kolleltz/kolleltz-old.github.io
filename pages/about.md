_**Kollel Toras Zeraim - Institute for Business Halacha**_ devotes itself to the research and advancement of "business halacha" and *Choshen Mishpat* (חושן משפט) as it pertains to the modern world, with a special emphasis on ethical issues confronting the businessperson.

Its goal is to train Torah scholars to be able to field questions from people in the business world, and to serve as a resource, where people from all over the world, can ask questions pertaining to "business halacha."

Questions are directed to members of the kollel, and they weigh in on the questions asked.

All questions are treated with the fullest confidentiality.
